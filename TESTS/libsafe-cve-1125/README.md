Requirements & Step by step instruction:
1. https://github.com/SRI-CSL/whole-program-llvm

2. edit ConAnalysis/TESTS/libsafe-cve-1125/libsafe-2.0-16/src/Makefile to change "CC=wllvm"
   add -g in CFLAGS (already changed, but double check it if you doubt)

3. make

4. extract-bc libsafe.so.2.0.16

5. opt -mem2reg *.bc -o *.mem2reg

6. mv *.mem2reg *.bc

Additional Notes:
Right now, because the compiling time for LLVM bitcode is too long for big applications.
We'll compile them beforehand and commit them to github. When building the whole project,
we can directly use them.
